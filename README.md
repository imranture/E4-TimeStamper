[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-win%20v0.4-blue)](https://github.com/imranture/E4-TimeStamper/releases/tag/v0.3-beta) [![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-macOS%20v1.0-red)](https://github.com/imranture/E4-TimeStamper/releases/tag/macOS-v1.0)

## What is it?
E4 TimeStamper automatically add timestamps to physiological data derived from Empatica's [E4 wristbands](https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/).

## How does it work? 
E4 TimeStamper extracts selected E4 zip file(s) and automatically timestamps each sample in each physiological data file (ACC.csv, BVP.csv, EDA.csv, HR.csv, IBI.csv and TEMP.csv) based on preferred timezone and date & time format, following the [guideline](https://support.empatica.com/hc/en-us/articles/201608896-Data-export-and-formatting-from-E4-connect-) provided by Empatica.

## Download & Installation
**`Windows`** : Download from [this link](https://github.com/imranture/E4-TimeStamper/raw/master/setup/win/E4-TimeStamper_Installer_v0-3.exe). Double click `E4-TimeStamper_Installer_v0-3.exe` and follow the instructions to install E4 TimeStamper.

**`macOS`** : Download from [this link](https://github.com/imranture/E4-TimeStamper/raw/master/setup/mac/E4-TimeStamper_macOS_v1-0.zip). Unzip `E4-TimeStamper_macOS_v1-0.zip` and drag the app file to Applications folder. Tested on macOS Sonoma 14.0!

## Instructions
#### Step 1:  Select E4 zip file(s)
Click `Browse` button and select only E4 zip file(s) containing physiological data you want to timestamp.

#### Step 2:  Choose (or type) timezone
Choose (or type) timezone based on the location where physiological data was collected.

#### Step 3:  Enter date and time formats
Specify the format of how physiological data should be timestamped. You may refer to [this cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/datetime) to learn how to do formatting.

#### Final Step: Run!
When you are ready, click `Run` button. Once it is done, you will receive a warning message informing that your E4 Files with timestamps are created in their relevant folders within the same directory with your selected E4 zip file(s).

Remember that E4 files are usually very large files, so timestamping process may take a while depending the number of selected files. Please be patient. It will do the heavy job for you.
